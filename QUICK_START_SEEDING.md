```json
{
  "colleges": 5,
  "courses": 25,
  "branches": 150,
  "students": 200,
  "subjects": 1200,
  "feeStructures": 150,
  "exams": 2400,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Sample Data Created

### Colleges with Real Details:
- **MAHA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING** (Bangalore)
- **STELLAR INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY** (Hyderabad)
- **APEX UNIVERSITY** (Mumbai)
- **PREMIER ENGINEERING COLLEGE** (Chennai)
- **ROYAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE** (Pune)

### Sample Student Data:
```json
{
  "name": "Aarav Sharma",
  "email": "aarav.sharma@student.mahacollege.edu.in",
  "phone": "+91-9876543210",
  "address": "123, Brigade Road, Bangalore - 560001",
  "studentId": "MABT2025001",

  "currency": "INR"
}
```

## Test the Complete System

After seeding, try these API calls to verify everything works:

### 1. Get All Students

GET /api/student
```

### 2. Get Students by College
```
GET /api/student/college/{collegeId}
```

### 3. Get Student Details with all Related Data
```
GET /api/student/{studentId}
GET /api/subject/branch/{branchId}
GET /api/feestructure/branch/{branchId}
GET /api/exam/branch/{branchId}
```
